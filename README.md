The Project is about the Image Generation and Segmentation of Vehicular Images. The user can Prompt the application to generate and segment an image and the generated images will be according to the description provided by the user
Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each and very pixel in an image into a class. These may be needed for various applications such as self driving cars, robotic system, damage detection etc. Collection of  thousands and millions of images and annotation for Semantic segmentations and scenario labelling involves considerable efforts and is time consuming. Hence This project mainly focuses on the Generation of images for autonmous car scenario sush as road marking, highways, streets, road users etc.
